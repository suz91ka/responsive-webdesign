        <ul>
          <li>History</li>
          <p>The Labrador breed dates back to at least the 1830s, when St. John's water dogs bred by European settlers in Newfoundland, were first introduced to Britain from ships trading between Canada and Poole in Dorsetshire.</p>
           <li>Characteristics</li>
           <p>There is a great deal of variety among Labradors. The following characteristics are typical of the conformation show bred (bench-bred) lines of this breed in the United States and are based on the American Kennel Club standard. </p>
            <li>Colour</li>
             <p>Labradors are registered in three colours: solid black, yellow (considered from creamy white to fox-red) and chocolate (medium to dark brown and originally called "liver").</p>
             <li>Show and field lines</li>
              <p>As a result of specialised breeding, there are significant differences between field and trial-bred and show-bred lines of Labradors.</p>
              <li>In war</li>
               <p>Labradors have been used as war dogs. During the Vietnam War they were used as scout dogs to track down dead or wounded soldiers or enemy positions.</p>
               <li>Health</li>
                <p>A Labrador may be expected to live for 10 to 12 years. It is a healthy breed with relatively few major problems. Notable issues related to health and well-being include inherited disorders and obesity (most are missing all or parts of the appetite-regulating POMC gene).</p>
                <li>Demography</li>
                 <p>There is no global stud-book for Labradors, nor is there detailed information on the numbers of Labradors living in each country. In 2005 the five countries with the largest numbers of Labrador registrations are the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Sweden and Finland.</p>
                 <li>Assistance dogs</li>
                  <p>Assistance dog' is the internationally established term for a dog that provides assistance to a disabled person, and is task-trained to help mitigate the handler's disability.</p>
